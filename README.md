# 3D print your brain

Run the `3Dprinting_brain.sh` script to create a 3D model of your brain from a structural image (T1).

To create a 3D surface model of your brain you use [FreeSurfer](http://freesurfer.net/), [pymeshlab](https://pymeshlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki). Therefore you should make sure that those are already installed on your system.
